# code-challenge

The project contains a new Next.js Typescript application with material-ui installed.

## Tasks
1. Check out the repository
2. Add components to the pages/index.tsx file to display the one page content described below.
3. Commit & Push the code to the repository. Feel free to push as often as you feel appropriate.


## Page Content

Recreate the following page:

![Page Image](page.png)

Create location dialog
![Create location](create_location_dialog.png)

The "Add date" button should create a new row with date and location inputs.

The "Create location" button should open a dialog with the inputs as show in the image. When a location is added it is saved to the "Locations" list and you can choose the location in the date rows.
"Edit location" opens the location dialog with the data of the location so you can edit it.

Hovering above the "i" icon should show a tooltip with text.

Both the side and top menu already exist as components in the project and can be reused. Of course existing material-ui can be utilized.
